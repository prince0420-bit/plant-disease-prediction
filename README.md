# 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction using Deep Learning

This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify plant diseases from leaf images, aiding in early detection and effective crop management.

## 📸 Dataset

Utilizes the [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset) containing over 50,000 images across 38 classes representing various plant species and diseases.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Preprocessing**: Images resized to 224×224 pixels; data augmentation techniques applied.
- **Model**: CNN-based architecture trained using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prince0420-bit/plant-disease-prediction.git
   cd plant-disease-prediction
